# #CNN vs RNN
* CNN:
** CNN take a fixed size input and generate fixed-size outputs.
** CNN is a type of feed-forward artificial neural network - are variations of multilayer perceptrons which are designed to use minimal amounts of preprocessing.
** CNNs use connectivity pattern between its neurons is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex, whose individual neurons are arranged in such a way that they respond to overlapping regions tiling the visual field.
** CNNs are ideal for images and videos processing.
* RNN:
** RNN can handle arbitrary input/output lengths.
** RNN, unlike feedforward neural networks, can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs.
** Recurrent neural networks use time-series information (i.e. what I spoke last will impact what I will speak next.)
** RNNs are ideal for text and speech analysis.
